# foodsnap

A social food network for foodies to share their snaps with their friends with some information such as: where these snaps has been taken, review on this cuisine and how much you got it, in addition to posting comments on your friends snaps. 

In the navbar, there is a [link](screenshots/add.png?raw=true) to a form to add your snap 

when you click on it, it will preview this form:
[ADD A SNAP FORM](screenshots/form.png?raw=true). In this form you will be able to add the "name" of the cuisine, photo, cost, location "where did you have it?", and a description or your review about the cuisine.

Once you click "submit" you will see your post on the "HOME" page.[Homepage preview](screenshots/preview.png?raw=true)
